## Tech Stack

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
*   **Retrofit:** A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
*   **Gson:** A powerful library for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
*   **OKHttp:** An efficient HTTP client that works seamlessly with Retrofit.
*   **ViewModel & LiveData:** Android Architecture Components for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## Architecture

The application follows a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

*   **View:** Activities and Fragments responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.
*   **ViewModel:**  Responsible for preparing and managing the data for the View. It interacts with the Repository.
*   **Repository:**  A layer that abstracts the data sources (in this case, the remote API via `WeatherRepository`).
*   **Model:** Data classes representing the weather information fetched from the API.
*   **API Service (`ApiService.kt`):** Defines the endpoints for communicating with the OpenWeatherMap API using Retrofit.
